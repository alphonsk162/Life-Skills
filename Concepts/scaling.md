# Performance and Scaling Investigation
This document investigates potential solutions to address the performance and scaling challenges in the current project. The focus is on exploring load balancing and vertical and horizontal scaling techniques.

## Scaling solutions
### Vertical Scaling
Increasing resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) of a single server.
#### When to Use:
* Simple applications with manageable traffic.
* When scaling out isnâ€™t feasible or required yet.
#### Pros:
* Easy to implement.
* Cost-effective for smaller loads.
#### Cons:
* Limited by hardware capacity.
* Single point of failure.
### Horizontal Scaling
Adding more servers to handle increased load.
#### When to Use:
* Applications expecting significant growth or variable traffic.
* When high availability and fault tolerance are required.
#### Pros:
* Highly scalable.
* Reduces risk of downtime.
* Flexible and cost-effective over time.
#### Cons:
* More complex to manage and configure.
* Requires load balancing.


## Load Balancing
Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving reliability, availability, and performance.

### Types of Load Balancers
#### Software Load Balancers:
* Examples: HAProxy, Nginx, Apache HTTP Server.
* Suitable for cloud and on-premise applications.
#### Cloud-based Load Balancers:
* Examples: AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Google Cloud Load Balancer.
* Ideal for scalable cloud-based architectures.
#### Benefits of Load Balancing
* Improves Performance: Ensures no single server is overloaded.
* High Availability: Distributes traffic to healthy servers, ensuring uptime.
* Scalable: Easily add more servers without disrupting service.

## Conclusion
To address the project's performance and scaling issues, horizontal scaling combined with appropriate load balancing is recommended for long-term scalability, high availability, and performance improvements.
