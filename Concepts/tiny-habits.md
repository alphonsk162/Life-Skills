# Tiny Habits

## Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me in this video is to include a tiny habit just after an already existing habit so it will be easier to remember and incorporate it into my routine.

## Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.


Motivation, Ability, and Prompt are the key elements that make forming new habits easier.
* **Motivation**: I'll make sure that the new habit doesn't require too much motivation. Always starting with easier tasks ensures that the required motivation is low.
* **Ability**: Keep the habit simple and easy by breaking it into small, manageable steps, making it easier to stay consistent.
* **Prompt**:  Iâ€™ll set a reminder or trigger to help me remember to do the habit, such as connecting it to an existing routine or choosing a specific time or place to perform it.

## Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? 

When you celebrate completing a habit, even if it's tiny, your confidence increases and it motivates you to keep doing it. So, it is really important to celebrate each small success.

## Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
