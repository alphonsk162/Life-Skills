### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?


Sexual harassment means unwanted and inappropriate actions of a sexual kind that make someone feel uncomfortable, scared, or disrespected. Here are common types of behaviors that can count as sexual harassment:

#### Verbal Sexual Harassment

* Making sexual jokes, comments, or teasing.
* Talking about someone’s body or appearance in a sexual way.
* Asking personal or inappropriate questions about someone’s private life.
* Requesting sexual favors or repeatedly asking someone out.

#### Visual Sexual Harassment

* Showing or sharing sexually explicit images, videos, or messages.
* Displaying posters, screensavers, or other materials with sexual content in shared spaces.
* Sending inappropriate content through emails, texts, or social media without consent.

#### Physical Sexual Harassment
* Touching someone without their permission, such as patting, pinching, or brushing against them.
* Hugging, kissing, or making physical advances without consent.
* Blocking someone’s path or standing too close to make them feel uncomfortable.
* Physically forcing someone into a sexual act or situation.



#### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

* **Speak up:** I would tell the person to stop the behavior.
* **Document:** I would keep a record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses.

* **Report:** I would report the behavior to a trusted authority, such as a supervisor or HR department.

* **Seek support:** I would reach out to friends, family, or support groups for emotional support and advice.

* **Consider legal action:** I would consult with a lawyer to explore options for taking legal action.
