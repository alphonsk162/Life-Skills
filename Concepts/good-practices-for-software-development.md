# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1

The points that were new to me are as follows:
* Ensure to ask questions and seek clarity in the meeting itself. Since most of the times, it will be difficult to get the same set of people online again.
* Getting frequent feedback during implementation phase.
* Using group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. 

## Question 2
Areas I need improvement:

* I need to track the time I work to improve productivity.
* I need to reduce my usage of social media.
* I need to improve my eating habits and focus on having quality food.
* I need to exercise every day to stay healthy and full of energy.
